    "Our final goal is to have a detector that can take a long .wav file (e.g.: 30 min) and tell us where within that file are the right whales upcalls.\n",
    "\n",
    "The core part of such detector will be a binary classifer that takes 3-s long spectrograms and classifies them into \"contains an upcall\" or \"does not contain an upcall\". We will treat these two classes as \"1\" and \"0\". This is what we'll cover in this tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [second part](https://docs.meridian.cs.dal.ca/ketos/tutorials/create_a_narw_detector/index.html) will take this binary classifier and turn it into a detector.\n",
